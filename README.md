## Customized Decison Tree 
I customized the decision tree algorithm by implementing key methods such as fit and predict, and employed the Gini index to calculate impurity. When tested on a synthetic dataset, it performed well on classification tasks, achieving accuracy nearly on par with the implementation in scikit-learn.
